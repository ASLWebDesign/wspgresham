Storm module for Drupal 6.x

INSTALLATION:

1) Copy this 'storm' directory into the /sites/all/modules directory of your Drupal installation.
(Multisite installations may wish to use a different directory - see http://drupal.org/node/53705)

2) Enable Storm (and whatever submodules of Storm that you wish), by visiting http://example.com/admin/build/modules. You will (almost) always need 'Storm', 'Storm Attribute' and 'Storm Organization'.

3) To enable the pdf invoice feature, you must separately install the tcpdf library (http://www.tcpdf.org). The install directory can be set at /admin/settings/storm/invoice. If you do not install the tcpdf library, Storm will still work, but you will not be able to view pdf versions of invoices.


CONFIGURATION:

- Set up permissions: Initially, it is recommended that you allow full access for your administrative role, and allow more once you are familiar with the system.

- There are a number of settings forms linked from http://example.com/admin/settings/storm. After installation, you should visit these pages and 

- Storm Attribute: This module gives additional settings for allowed field values, and values you can search for on the lists. In later versions of Storm, this may become part of the standard settings forms.


DISABLING / UNINSTALL:

1) Visit http://example.com/admin/build/modules in your web-browser and deselect the modules that you wish to disable. To uninstall, select the uninstall tab and follow the on screen instructions.

2) Warnings may appear on disabling stating that nodes have not been deleted. This is because several of the Storm modules use the existing Drupal node system to store information. Therefore, on disabling the module, these nodes are not deleted. It is suggested that you may wish to delete these manually by visiting http://example.com/admin/content/node and filtering by the stated content type.


HELP:

- It is understandable that Storm may appear intimidating at first glance due to the number of modules in the package. Do not be afraid!
